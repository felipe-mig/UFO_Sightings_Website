‚ô¶Ô∏è You may need a local server and import the database to display the website on your browser. 

## üìí How to run a local server

You can use MAMP or XAMPP as free options:

https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/

https://www.apachefriends.org/

MAMP EXAMPLE (XAMPP works in the same way):

If you followed the default installation parameters, the directory to run the local server should be on this path: 

   C:\MAMP

Steps to start the server:

1. Start the server by running the <strong>MAMP.exe</strong> file. Next, initiate the Apache Server and MySQL Server if they don't do it automatically

2. At the same directory level where MAMP.exe is located, look for the <strong>htdocs</strong> folder and delete it.

3. Replace the removed <strong>htdocs</strong> folder for the one on this project.

4. In your browser type the following URL: 

   127.0.0.1:80/phpMyAdmin5/

5. Go to home and look for the <strong>User accounts</strong> tab on the top nav bar.

6. Click on <strong>Add user account</strong> and fill it with the following information: 

  - User name: <i>mri</i>
  - Host name: <i>localhost</i>
  - Password: <i>password</i>

7. Below, look for the <strong>global privileges</strong> label and set it to Check all.

8. On the right side nav bar look for New, and create a database with the same name as the SQL file. 

   In this case:  <i>ufo.sql</i>

9. Once it is done, go to the recently created database. Next, on the top nav bar look for the <strong>Import</strong> tab.

10. Browse the SQL file on your computer and click on <strong>Go</strong>.
